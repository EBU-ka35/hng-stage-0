## üê± Dynamic Profile API (Stage Zero Backend Task)

A simple RESTful API built with **FastAPI** that returns your profile information along with a **dynamic cat fact** fetched from the [Cat Facts API](https://catfact.ninja/fact).

This project demonstrates consuming a third-party API, formatting JSON responses, handling errors gracefully, and returning dynamic data.
